If you have watched Tripura: The Animated Movie and enjoyed it, you might be interested in learning more about the legend behind it. Tripura Sundari, also known as Lalita or Shodashi, is one of the ten Mahavidyas, the great wisdom goddesses in Hinduism. She is the supreme manifestation of the Mother Goddess, who creates and destroys the universe with her power.
 
Tripura Sundari is depicted as a beautiful young woman with four arms, holding a lotus, a bow, an arrow, and a noose. She sits on a throne made of five corpses, representing the five elements and the five senses. She is surrounded by a circle of lotus petals and a square of walls with four gates, representing the sixteen aspects of desire and the four aims of life. She is also associated with the Sri Yantra, a complex geometric diagram that symbolizes the cosmos and the union of Shiva and Shakti.
 
Tripura Sundari is worshipped as the goddess of beauty, love, joy, and bliss. She grants her devotees prosperity, happiness, and liberation. She is also the protector of Tripura, a mythical city that was once ruled by three powerful demons. According to the legend, these demons performed a great sacrifice and obtained three flying fortresses made of gold, silver, and iron. They used these fortresses to conquer and oppress the gods and humans. The gods appealed to Shiva for help, but he could not destroy the fortresses unless they aligned in a straight line. This only happened once every thousand years, for a brief moment. Shiva asked his consort Parvati to assist him, and she assumed the form of Tripura Sundari. She seduced the demons and made them fight among themselves. She also used her charm to distract them from their fortresses. When the fortresses aligned, Shiva shot a single arrow and destroyed them all. Thus, Tripura Sundari helped Shiva save the world from the tyranny of the demons.
